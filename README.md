## Handwritten English Character Recognition using CNN

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing both uppercase and lowercase handwritten English characters. The model demonstrates high accuracy with 94.36% for uppercase characters and 88.97% for lowercase characters.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust CNN model that can accurately recognize handwritten English characters, distinguishing between both uppercase and lowercase letters. The model is designed to handle real-world handwritten text recognition tasks.

Key Achievements

Uppercase Character Recognition Accuracy: 94.36% 
Lowercase Character Recognition Accuracy: 88.97%
